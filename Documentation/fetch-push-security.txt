SECURITY
--------
The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent a malicious
server from stealing data from your repository that you did not intend to
share. The possible attacks are similar to the ones described in the
"SECURITY" section of linkgit:gitnamespaces[7]. If you have private data
that you need to protect from the server, keep it in a separate
repository.
