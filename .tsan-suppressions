# Suppressions for ThreadSanitizer (tsan).
#
# This file is used by setting the environment variable TSAN_OPTIONS to, e.g.,
# "suppressions=$(pwd)/.tsan-suppressions". Observe that relative paths such as
# ".tsan-suppressions" might not work.
#
# These suppressions can be, e.g., that a static variable is written to and it
# is always the same value being written, so it doesn't really matter that two
# or more such writes race.
